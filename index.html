    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>1. Problem - Starting a new game can be extremely stressful for beginners, especially when it is loaded with detail-specific mechanics and a steep learning curve. If a game fails to hook new users at the start with a poor tutorial, or fails to continually provide the player with help, it is very likely that the users will lose interest/become frustrated. 
      </p><br>
      <p>2. Target Users - A target audience of this application is people who are new to a specific game or playing games in general, and who would want a web application that helps explain mechanics. Another group of target users is novice players who know a game already, but may have forgotten how certain elements work (Perhaps they played it for a short while and just now have time to play again a few months down the line from when they started). The ages of these users should be able to range from teens to adults.
      </p><br>
      <p>3. Solution - Develop a web application that provides information about game mechanics, as well as interactive interfaces that can simulate certain elements of the game and provide explanation (ie. a crafting recipe system). This website can also explain characteristics of the game, so for those who are easily startled, they have a small bit of knowledge so their hearts continue functioning well after a terrifying experience has happened. The application can cover one or several games, depending on time constraints. Possible games to go over include Subnatica, Terraria, Warframe, and the Binding of Isaac.

      <h4>Subnautica Deep Dive</h4>
      <h5>Problem</h5>
      <p> Subnautica is a vast, open-world survival game unlike many others, since most of the world is underwater. Although exploration and discovery are a large part of the game, the lack of direction can be quite intimidating, especially for new players. Subnautica Deep Dive aims to assist players with this issue, giving them direction and information about the game without completely spoiling the plot.

      <h5>Problem Senarios and Tasks</h5>
      <div>
        <h6>Problem Scenario - Joleen Moccasin</h6>

        <p>Joleen had been playing Subnautica for a couple hours now and she was enjoying finding new fish and such, aside from some early frustrations with how small her oxygen tank was until she figured out how to make a bigger one. She noticed that there was an even bigger one to make and so she set off to find the crafting components. Unfortunately, she spent the next hour and a half unable to find the piece of silver she needed, and when she did finally find it she accidentally died to one of the exploding fish. After respawning in the escape pod, she noticed that she had lost the silver she had worked for so long and hard to get and she had no idea how to get back to where she died to pick it up. This was enough to cause Joleen to quit her session of playing, feeling frustrated and angry.</p>

        <h6>Tasks - Joleen Moccasin</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>Died and lost resources</li>
          <li>Can’t find a specific resource or blueprint after looking for a long time</li>
          <li>Coming back to game later and forgetting what the last task was</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Problem Scenario - Carl Hansen</h6>

        <p>Carl has just finished a large project for work and is happy that he finally has a chance to get back to Subnautica. Unfortunately, when he starts up the game, he struggles to remember what he was doing during his last play session. He feels that after such a long period of time he may need to simply start a new game file to refamiliarize himself, but he’d rather not lose the progress he spent so much of his precious free time on. He decides that he’d rather not start a new game and loads up his old save file. He’s a bit confused as to his goal and spends most of his time just building up his base and after playing for a bit, he wishes that he could have remembered what was happening last time so he can make some more progress with the story.</p>

        <h6>Tasks - Carl Hansen</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>Needs some sort of walkthrough/ story synopsis</li>
          <li>Needs a crafting section that goes over what materials are needed and what they make</li>
          <li>Needs information on materials, locations, enemies, etc. for the user to gauge what is needed to collect them/face them, and to see how much of a challenge these things present</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Problem Scenario - Parker Sanchez</h6>

        <p>Parker gets home from school on friday looking forward to trying out his new game. He boots it up and starts the game, picking the first option in each selection assuming that is what he should do. He gets through the opening cutscene and puts of the fire, and after finishing the quick tutorials the game gives him he is not sure where to go next. He leaves the escape pod and swims around for a bit learning about things like needing to resurface for air and that there are rocks that he can break to get shiny resources. However he is at a loss for what to do next. He also wonders how to get a bigger oxygen tank so he can explore underwater for longer as he is a little annoyed at having to resurface constantly. After a bit of searching he manages to find the resources necessary to construct the repair tool and fixes the escape pod and after that doesn’t have much clue as to what he should do next. His experience has also been somewhat marred by the poor performance of his older laptop.</p>

        <h6>Tasks - Parker Sanchez</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>Needs an overview of settings so new players can understand how to set up the game for their system</li>
          <li>Needs an example playthrough so players have a rough idea of the order of events</li>
          <li>Needs a section that details what items do and how to upgrade them</li>
        </ul>
      </div><br>

      <h6>Instructions</h6>

      <p>Navigate to the Figma page through the link above and click the Start button in the top right corner to begin the prototype.</p>

      <h6>Prototype Tool Choice: Figma</h6>
      <div class="w3-row">
        <div class="w3-half w3-container">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/figma.png" alt="Figma Logo">
        </div>
        <div class="w3-half w3-container">
          <ul>
            <br>
            <li>Performance felt better than the other recommended tools</li>
            <li>Very easy to link components to make the prototype function</li>
            <li>Although it struggled to give user feedback on buttons, none of the given options apparently had that feature</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h6>Design Choices</h6>
      <p>
      <li>Did not implement images into the prototype (used placeholders)</li>
      There is a large volume of pictures that our website will use, so placeholders were used to save time
      <li>Not every section of the website is fully implemented</li>
      Focused on implementing sections related to tasks
      <li>Few Aesthetics</li>
      Focused more on getting feedback on functionality and placement over which colors are more appealing
      <li>Few leaves of the tree design</li>
      Most of the leaves will give specific info on a fish, resource, etc. so implementing them all would have been a massive time sink
      <li>Not a large amount of descriptive text</li>
      Different things like, beacon names, resources names, etc. not added since there was a high volume of individual entries, so placeholders used instead
      </p>

      <h5>Formative Evaluation</h5>

      <h6>List of Problems</h6>

      <ul>
        <li> Lack of scroll bars in prototype (P1, P2) (low)</li>
        <li> Lack of search boxes in prototype (P1, P2) (low)</li>
        <li> Poor wording (P1, P2, P3) (high)</li>

        <li> Lack of images/icons (P1,P2) (high)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Using the above problems, we created three groups to categorized and address them.</p>

      <div class="w3-row">
        <div class="w3-third w3-container">
          <h6>Navigation Issues</h6>
          <strong>-Search and Scroll Bars were unintuitive or lacking (P1, P2) (low)</strong>
          <li>Lack of search boxes to look through different resources</li>
          <li>Home page Search bar is not prominent enough</li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Recommended to put over buttons rather than below <br>
          <li>Difficult to see that you are able to scroll through</li>
          <strong>-Overarching navigation buttons lacking (P1,P2,P3) (high)</strong>
          <li>Would like home button (P1)</li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Other buttons to view “tree” would be helpful <br>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Could address by making sure links appear in sub heading, including the Home button <br>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Note: The “Back” button got positive feedback during reviews (P1,P2) Would be good to include in future iterations <br>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-third w3-container">
          <h6>Aesthetic Issues</h6>
          <strong>-Site is visually lacking (P1, P2) (low)</strong>
          <li>everything is in black, white, and gray</li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Could fix by adding color, styling, etc. <br>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> One reviewer recommended adding a color gradient as you scroll down on site or in sub-box <br>
          <strong>-Images are largely missing from the site (P1,P2) (high)</strong>
          <li>No image example for such a visual game is a hindrance</li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Additional images would be good to include both for visuals and logic reasons <br>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-third w3-container">
          <h6>Logical Issues</h6>
          <strong>-Button questions are ambiguous/confusing (P2, P3) (high)</strong>
          <li>Unclear what the questions meant</li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Could address by using image/icons to add supplementary information <br>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Also make questions clearer (ie “Are you new to the game?” rather than “New?”) <br>
          <strong>-Feedback for Buttons Lacking (P2, P3) (med)</strong>
          <li>Difficult to know if button has been clicked</li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Fix by adding hover effects and loading as needed <br>
          <strong>-Wording was poor (P1, P2, P3) (high) </strong>
          <li>Titles and information wasn’t descriptive enough </li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Make titles and subheadings clearer and more descriptive <br>
          <strong>-Site description missing (P2) (med) </strong>
          <li>New users would be confused coming to the site without some information</li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Add a description explaining what the site is about <br>
          <strong>-Lack of in depth New Player Section (P3) (high) </strong>
          <li>Explanation of start of game/ where to go was lacking </li>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Could improve by adding more information <br>
          &emsp; &emsp; -> Create more subsections as needed for specific topics <br>

      <h5>Subnautica Deep Dive</h5>

      <p>Subnautica is a vast, open-world survival game unlike many others, since most of the world is underwater. Although exploration and discovery are a large part of the game, the lack of direction can be quite intimidating, especially for new players. Subnautica Deep Dive aims to assist players with this issue, giving them direction and information about the game without completely spoiling the plot.</p>
      
      <h5>Tasks</h5>

      <p><strong>(1.)</strong> The first core task our prototype supports is being able to use the website to find a resource such as copper.</p>

      <p><strong>(2.)</strong> The second core task our prototype supports is giving the user resources to refresh themselves as to what they were doing during their last play session through a browsable signal list. After looking up their most recent signal, they can see information on what they may have been doing.</p>

      <p><strong>(3.)</strong> The third core task was originally about optimizing system settings for running Subnautica, however, we decided that including that was too large for our scope. Instead, we opted to shift our third core task to helping players who have just started Subnautica and are unsure of how the game works.</p>

      <h5>How We Chose the Scope</h5>
      <p>Since the scope of this game is so large, and we only had so long to develop this prototype, we had to pick and choose what would be included. <br><br>Most of the things we chose within a ten number limit are essential to the game's progression and story plotline. There are still a few blueprints that are considered important but they did not shared the same importance as the ones we chose, like Scanner and the vehicles. Vehicles allow for deeper diving, while the scanner is integral for collecting blueprints and information about the world.<br><br>The dangerous fauna, in the ten number limit we set ourselves, are the more aggressive and dangerous hostile fauna in the game.<br><br>For the biomes, we only included the surface ones since they were clearly demarcated on the map. <br><br> Overall, we tried to select a reasonably sized subsection of the game to display on our site without overwhelming ourselves with a large data requirement.</p>


      <h5>Libraries and Frameworks</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>For this project we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
        <li>We used the w3 schools framework and some element of Bootstrap</li>
        <li>For the JavaScript, we included the jquery library and the search widget from the programming assignments</li>
        <li>Our data was either pulled/adapted from the subnautica wiki page or based on personal experiences and knowledge of playing the game </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Reflections and Division of Work</h5>
      <h6>Ben</h6>
      <p><strong>Contribution:</strong> I collected the majority of the information for the Story Information and Mineral sections of the website as well as contributing to the information in the non-hostile fauna section, and the collecting of the many images used on our site. I also worked on the filter for the dropdowns, the background color gradient changing as you go further into the website, and the section descriptions. <br><br>Finding information for the website could be difficult at time for things that were not individual entities. The most prominent example of which was finding information for the story section. I had to spend a lot of time researching the triggers for the signals so I could write up helpful information based on what the player could be doing at the time, although I suspect that they will need revising after getting feedback. The dropdown item filter took a little bit of trial and error to get right but there were very helpful resources to reference. <br><br>From this project I learned how to better find information through a variety of sources, especially ones that may not seem to be obvious choices at first.
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h6>Nathan</h6>
      <p><strong>Contribution:</strong> I did the code for the menu creation, hover effects, and search bar. I also contributed the information and images for the biomes,  the descriptions for the flora, and the images for the new player section,  the story information, the buttons. I also did various parts of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a lot of formatting files and text to fit work with the code.<br><br>This project was quite challenging at places, especially the beginning when the structure of the site was not defined. It was challenging building code in a way that could be expanded, and required a lot of forethought. After the menu, html generation, filtering, and searching was done, however, it was really only a simple but tedious process of data entry. In addition, CSS always gives me some trouble, however, the addition of additional frameworks helped a lot.<br><br>This project furthered my understanding of jquery, especially when it comes to dynamic generation of HTML. It makes me respect the importance of backend web development even more. In addition, I learned alot about the design process, and appreciated how useful it was to have strong frameworks to make a site.
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h6>Jackie</h6>
      <p><strong>Contribution:</strong> I collected information for the Blueprints, recorded descriptions for the Dangerous fauna, and wrote up the information for new players. I also did the code for generating the images and description for each menu Item.<br><br>This project was definitely way more intense than I thought, and this is only addressing a few things about subnautica. There are many more blueprints and biomes, but I still enjoyed working on this project. To me, it’s a lot easier to be looking at this website to find things instead of personally searching for everything. The option of seeing the different creatures helps with identifying without using a scanner, and having the different locations stated quickly helps with understanding the material. I had a some help from Nathan when it came to pointing me in the right direction for generating images.<br><br>Jquery was definitely a challenge for me, as I have never really experienced playing with it until this class. Still, it was a lot of fun. I’ve learned that sometimes the scope of what we want to happen isn’t always feasible in a timeline. I’ve learned to be more conscious of exactly how much work goes into a project and to better pace myself.

      </a>

    <h5>List of Questions</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>Where would you find information on resources like copper?</li>
        <li>Assuming you had played the game previously, where could you find information on what you may have been doing story-wise?</li>
        <li>If you were a new player to Subnautica, where could you find information to help you get started?</li>
        <li>Would you actually use this website and if so, how would you use it? If not, why would you not use it?</li>
        <li>In what way might the website give too much away about the game, effectively ruining the magic of exploring for yourself?</li>
        <li>How do the aesthetics of this site impact the ability to get information and navigate through it?</li>
        <li>Do you have any suggestions for the website?</li>
      </ol>

    <h5>Participants</h5>
      
        <h6>P1</h6>
        <p>Friend recruited by asking if they would be interested in reviewing a website about Subnautica. Interview conducted over Discord.</p>
        <p>They are representative of target users, by representing veteran players who may use the site as a reference guide. Has played subnautica before and completed it multiple times and has a high level of ability in regards to playing games.They gave the unique perspective on what resources they consider the most important to starting out, based on what they learned through playing. 
        </p>
        <p>The main takeaway from the session was that the map is one of the most useful features on the site and that we need to account for multiple platforms.</p>

        <h6>P2</h6>
        <p>Friend recruited by asking if they would be interested in reviewing a website about Subnautica. Interview conducted over Discord.</p>
        <p>They are representative of target users, by representing new players who have never played the game before, but understand the basic structure of the game, and are interested in trying it. Has not played subnautica but has seen bits of other people playing it and is interested in it and has a high amount of experience with video games. They were unique in that they were very interested in actually using the website in the future even in its current iteration. </p>
        <p>The main takeaway from this session would be that the way the website does not flood the user with information is a good thing and possibly should remain in future iterations.</p>

        <h6>P3</h6>
        <p>Friend, recruited by asking if they would be interested in reviewing a website about Subnautica. Interview conducted over Discord.</p>
        <p>They are representative of target users, by representing new players who have never played the game before and have seen very little of the game beforehand. Has a large amount of experience with games and has never played subnautica before, has seen a little of it through youtube videos. What makes this tester unique was that they were analyzing the way colors were used on the website as they have a background with color theory.</p>
        <p>The main takeaway from this session would be that the color choices for the website may be good for further iterations, but to maybe add some form of spoiler functionality for certain information.</p>

        <h6>P4</h6>
        <p>Friend of a friend over a Discord Server and current college student. Recruited by asking the server if anyone had played Subnautica and was interested in reviewing a website for the game. The interview was conducted over Discord.</p>
        <p>He has played around 50 hours of Subnautica,  understanding the basics of gameplay as well as playing around with more advanced concepts like building. In addition, he had made it pretty far into the story.Had experience with the game and was able to look back in hindsight for what sort of information might have been useful </p>
        <p>The main takeaway was that he appreciated the information and presentation within the website, and would have found it handy if he was a new player.</p>

        <h6>P5</h6>
        <p>Previous college classmate who has now graduated from URI. For recruitment, she was asked in person if she was interested in doing an interview for the Subnautica Website.</p>
        <p>She has not played Subnautica, but is familiar with playing games in general. She doesn’t like to be lost in games, and prefers more direction when playing. Participant  was familiar with the process of design, giving a lot of feedback about the visuals of the site. Took emphasis away from the information, but was able to use other similar games to infer how she would use the information</p>
        <p>The main takeaway was that she would use a site like this if she was first starting Subnautica, however, it has several issues that hurt the professionalism of the site.</p>

        <h6>P6</h6>
        <p>High School Friend, asked online if he was open to reviewing a Subnautica website. Interview conducted over Discord.</p>
        <p>Played Subnautica several times. Does Speedruns for fun now. Person was kept completely out of the designing loop. Would use the site if he didn’t know how the game works so well already.</p>
        <p>Main Takeaway: Site is fantastic and awesome to look at. If they didn’t already know Subnautica so well, they would use it.</p>

        <h6>P7</h6>
        <p>Friend met over PVP Game. Asked if they could do me a favor and review Subnautica, considering I just watched him play it. Interview conducted over Discord.</p>
        <p>Interested after I complained about the excessive blueprints and wanted to try. Besides complaints about too much information in subnautica, has no knowledge of website Would use the site for his first run… Definitely needed it if it had all information available.</p>
        <p>Main Takeaway: Site is very nice to look at and look through. If they didn’t already play through the game, they would come to this website for help when they got stuck.</p>




    <h5>Usability Lessons</h5>
      <div class="w3-row">
        <div class="w3-third w3-container">
          <h6>Navigation Concerns</h6>
          <strong>-Scroll position in a list does not stay after selecting a new entry in that list. (P2, P7) (med)</strong><br>
          <strong>-The section headers might need to be more obvious that they can be used for navigation. (P3, P5) (high)</strong>
          <li>Link to homepage unclear in header, would like title to be link (P5)</li>
          <li>Add logo that also acts as link (P5)</li>
          <strong>-Map is uninteractive, deprives user of useful feature (P6) (low)</strong>
          <li>Would help navigation if you could hover over section of map to jump to that section</li>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-third w3-container">
          <h6>Aesthetic Concerns</h6>
          <strong>-Main page contains a large amount of unused space (P2) (low)</strong>
          <li>Somewhat good,  shouldn’t be too much on the main page to avoid flooding the user with information </li>
          <li>potentially have more pictures somewhere</li>
          <strong>-Not visually engaging before hover effects on button pages (P5) (high)</strong><br>
          <strong>-Fonts should be more basic for paragraphs (P5) (med)</strong>
          <li>Could use contrast improvements, size increase as well</li>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-third w3-container">
          <h6>Logical Concerns</h6>
          <strong>-Only information about PC movement, no console controls available. (P1) (med)</strong><br>
          <strong>-Spoiler feature missing, such as the big monsters that would normally take the player by surprise (P1, P3, P7) (high)</strong><br>
          <strong>-Missing additional pictures from the crafting UI for the Blueprints (P4) (low)</strong><br>
          <strong>-Site descriptions are poorly worded (P5) (high)</strong><br>
          <li>lacks an authoritative, professional voice</li>
          <strong>-New player section feels disjointed from rest of the site, should be more integrated (P7) (high)</strong>

      <h5>High Level Reflection</h5>

      <p>Overall we learned that it is very important to word interview questions well, and that you really need to make sure that you are giving people open-ended questions, since it can be very easy to give close-ended questions if you don’t pay attention. We also learned to really pay attention to what the participants would be doing to pick up on things they didn’t say but visually looked like they were struggling with.</p>
      <p>If we were to redo this process, we would probably come up with more questions to ask since many participants gave mostly positive feedback and for some it was difficult to get constructive criticism. Another thing that could help would be to do more dry runs with the questions, as we probably didn’t do enough of them.</p>

      <h5>Contributions</h5>

      <p><strong>Jackie:</strong> 2 testers recruited, interviewed, and described in slides (P6, P7), restated problem statement and tasks, some high level reflection details</p>

      <p><strong>Nathan:</strong> 2 testers recruited, interviewed, and described in slides (P4, P5), organized types of problems, created consent form, updated site</p>

      <p><strong>Ben:</strong>  3 testers recruited, interviewed, and described in slides (P1, P2, P3), worked on interview questions, drafted most of high level reflection</p>

      <p>Equal time spent working on questions to ask during interviews and analyzing results.</p>
