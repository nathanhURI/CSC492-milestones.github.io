      <p>1. Problem - Starting a new game can be extremely stressful for beginners, especially when it is loaded with detail-specific mechanics and a steep learning curve. If a game fails to hook new users at the start with a poor tutorial, or fails to continually provide the player with help, it is very likely that the users will lose interest/become frustrated. 
      </p><br>
      <p>2. Target Users - A target audience of this application is people who are new to a specific game or playing games in general, and who would want a web application that helps explain mechanics. Another group of target users is novice players who know a game already, but may have forgotten how certain elements work (Perhaps they played it for a short while and just now have time to play again a few months down the line from when they started). The ages of these users should be able to range from teens to adults.
      </p><br>
      <p>3. Solution - Develop a web application that provides information about game mechanics, as well as interactive interfaces that can simulate certain elements of the game and provide explanation (ie. a crafting recipe system). This website can also explain characteristics of the game, so for those who are easily startled, they have a small bit of knowledge so their hearts continue functioning well after a terrifying experience has happened. The application can cover one or several games, depending on time constraints. Possible games to go over include Subnatica, Terraria, Warframe, and the Binding of Isaac.

      <h4>Subnautica Deep Dive</h4>
      <h5>Problem</h5>
      <p> Subnautica is a vast, open-world survival game unlike many others, since most of the world is underwater. Although exploration and discovery are a large part of the game, the lack of direction can be quite intimidating, especially for new players. Subnautica Deep Dive aims to assist players with this issue, giving them direction and information about the game without completely spoiling the plot.

      <h5>Problem Senarios and Tasks</h5>
      <div>
        <h6>Problem Scenario - Joleen Moccasin</h6>

        <p>Joleen had been playing Subnautica for a couple hours now and she was enjoying finding new fish and such, aside from some early frustrations with how small her oxygen tank was until she figured out how to make a bigger one. She noticed that there was an even bigger one to make and so she set off to find the crafting components. Unfortunately, she spent the next hour and a half unable to find the piece of silver she needed, and when she did finally find it she accidentally died to one of the exploding fish. After respawning in the escape pod, she noticed that she had lost the silver she had worked for so long and hard to get and she had no idea how to get back to where she died to pick it up. This was enough to cause Joleen to quit her session of playing, feeling frustrated and angry.</p>

        <h6>Tasks - Joleen Moccasin</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>Died and lost resources</li>
          <li>Can’t find a specific resource or blueprint after looking for a long time</li>
          <li>Coming back to game later and forgetting what the last task was</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Problem Scenario - Carl Hansen</h6>

        <p>Carl has just finished a large project for work and is happy that he finally has a chance to get back to Subnautica. Unfortunately, when he starts up the game, he struggles to remember what he was doing during his last play session. He feels that after such a long period of time he may need to simply start a new game file to refamiliarize himself, but he’d rather not lose the progress he spent so much of his precious free time on. He decides that he’d rather not start a new game and loads up his old save file. He’s a bit confused as to his goal and spends most of his time just building up his base and after playing for a bit, he wishes that he could have remembered what was happening last time so he can make some more progress with the story.</p>

        <h6>Tasks - Carl Hansen</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>Needs some sort of walkthrough/ story synopsis</li>
          <li>Needs a crafting section that goes over what materials are needed and what they make</li>
          <li>Needs information on materials, locations, enemies, etc. for the user to gauge what is needed to collect them/face them, and to see how much of a challenge these things present</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Problem Scenario - Parker Sanchez</h6>

        <p>Parker gets home from school on friday looking forward to trying out his new game. He boots it up and starts the game, picking the first option in each selection assuming that is what he should do. He gets through the opening cutscene and puts of the fire, and after finishing the quick tutorials the game gives him he is not sure where to go next. He leaves the escape pod and swims around for a bit learning about things like needing to resurface for air and that there are rocks that he can break to get shiny resources. However he is at a loss for what to do next. He also wonders how to get a bigger oxygen tank so he can explore underwater for longer as he is a little annoyed at having to resurface constantly. After a bit of searching he manages to find the resources necessary to construct the repair tool and fixes the escape pod and after that doesn’t have much clue as to what he should do next. His experience has also been somewhat marred by the poor performance of his older laptop.</p>

        <h6>Tasks - Parker Sanchez</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>Needs an overview of settings so new players can understand how to set up the game for their system</li>
          <li>Needs an example playthrough so players have a rough idea of the order of events</li>
          <li>Needs a section that details what items do and how to upgrade them</li>
        </ul>
      </div><br>
